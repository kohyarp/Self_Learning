    "Asystole (cardiac arrest due to absent electrical activity) is identified by ICD-9 code 427.5 – Cardiac Arrest. It is a form of cardiac arrest where there is no electrical activity in the heart, often leading to sudden death if not treated immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many reasons why this can occur, potentially leading to either recovery or death. In this study, we aim to predict the mortality rate and evaluate whether machine learning can analyze patient history, lab results, and other relevant clinical data to predict the risk of cardiac arrest and the likelihood of survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the complexity of this project, my primary focus will be on the second half of the study—assessing the probability of survival following a cardiac arrest episode. Specifically, I aim to determine whether machine learning models can predict, with a certain level of confidence, whether a patient is likely to recover or pass away based on their medical history and other clinical factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the compelxity of the proejct, I have chosen to wokr on a simple problem of Binary Classification: Predict survival vs. death after cardiac arrest. The problem is complec in nature and required extracting meaningful temporal patterns from labs, vitals, medications, etc whoch is out f the scope of my project and my ability. Thus I ahve chosen a simple scope of binary c;asisfication by chosing csom critcal feature selection that deemed to be crrucuial to patients' survival. \n",
    "I will skip Complex Preprocessing of MIMIC-III tables and avoid raw time-series data processing as well.\n"
